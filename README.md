# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project uses an autoencoder model to detect fraud in credit card transactions. It includes data preprocessing, model training, anomaly detection, and visualization with Streamlit.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Autoencoder model training
- Anomaly detection with a defined threshold
- Performance evaluation with metrics like F1-score
- Visualization of results using Streamlit
